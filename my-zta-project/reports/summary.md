- Authentication with MFA support
- Device posture checking
- Micro-segmentation policies
- Central logging with multiple sinks

### Security Features
- Attack simulation (credential stuffing, lateral movement, ransomware)
- Anomaly detection
- Security metrics and analysis
- Policy enforcement

### Usability Features
- Task simulation
- SUS score calculation
- Friction event tracking
- User satisfaction metrics

### Analysis Tools
- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis
- Statistical comparisons
- Visualization tools
- Report generation

## Implementation Details

### ZTA Controls
- **Authentication**: Password + MFA
- **Device Posture**: OS version, firewall, antivirus, encryption, patches
- **Segmentation**: Resource-based access policies

### Attack Scenarios
